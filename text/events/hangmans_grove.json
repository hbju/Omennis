            "description": "In the midst of the vast, rolling plains stands the Hangman's Grove, a tight, isolated cluster of ancient, gnarled oaks. It's the only feature for miles, a dark knot of wood and shadow on the open grasslands. A strange silence hangs under its boughs, and its largest tree bears a single, thick, low-hanging branch that looks unnervingly like a gibbet. It's a place travelers speak of in hushed tones, a known haunt for bandits and worse.",
