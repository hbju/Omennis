	"description": "The iron-banded gates of Gall screech open, revealing a city hunched beneath a perpetually overcast sky. Cobbled streets, slick with refuse, wind between soot-stained buildings leaning like weary drunkards. The air hangs thick with the smell of coal smoke, stale ale, and damp desperation. Stern-faced guards, their armor scarred, watch your passage with weary eyes. Gall endures, but it doesn't welcome.",
