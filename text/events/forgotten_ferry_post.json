            "description": "On a quiet bend of the Logauc river, you find the Forgotten Ferry Post. All that remains is a small, collapsed stone building, its roof long gone, and the rotting stumps of an old wooden pier disappearing into the muddy water. A single, half-sunken rowboat is tangled in the reeds nearby. This place was once a vital crossing, but with Oldbridge's new bridges and industry, it has been left to be slowly consumed by the river and time.",
