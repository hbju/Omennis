Its colossal trunk, wider than a house, lies across the landscape, now covered in a thick blanket of moss and sprouting fungi the size of shields. The massive, upturned root ball is a wall of earth and stone, and the hollowed sections of its trunk are large enough to serve as caves, home to all manner of creatures.",
