            "description": "You enter the Knotted Weald, an ancient forest where the trees have grown into a dense, tangled lattice. Gnarled roots, as thick as a man's waist, writhe across the forest floor, creating a treacherous, uneven path. The canopy above is so thick that it chokes the light, casting the undergrowth in a perpetual, gloomy twilight. Every snap of a twig sounds unnaturally loud in the oppressive silence.",
