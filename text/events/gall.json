Worn cobbles pave streets that wind between tightly packed buildings, their upper stories often leaning close, casting long shadows. The air is sharp with the tang of coal smoke and the distant clang of a smithy, mingled with the everyday scents of a populous, if somewhat grim, settlement. Guards in practical, scuffed armor observe your passage with a practiced, neutral gaze. Gall is a place of pragmatism, not pleasantries.",
