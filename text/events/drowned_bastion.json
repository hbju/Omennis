            "description": "Further up the Lodroi river stands the Drowned Bastion. The skeletal remains of a single, stout watchtower and its surrounding walls jut from the sullen, slow-moving water. Thick vines and river moss cling to the water-logged stones. The only sounds are the gentle lapping of the river against the decaying masonry and the distant cry of a lone river bird. It is a place of deep melancholy and forgotten history.",
