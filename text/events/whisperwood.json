The ancient, silver-barked trees seem to lean in, their leaves brushing against each other in a sibilant chorus. Faint, ethereal lights drift between the trunks like fireflies. The elves consider this a sacred, communicative place; for outsiders, the endless, unintelligible whispering can be deeply unsettling.",
