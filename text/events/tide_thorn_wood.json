            "description": "South of Longshore lies the Tide-Thorn Wood. This is no grand forest, but a grim, hardy woodland locked in a constant battle with the sea. The trees are stunted and bent, their branches permanently twisted away from the coast by the salt-laden winds. The ground is a mix of sandy soil and tough, sharp-edged grasses. The air is filled with the sound of the wind whipping through the hardy pines and the distant roar of the ocean.",
