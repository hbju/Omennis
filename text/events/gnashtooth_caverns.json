            "description": "At the rugged edge where the Falroh Forest gives way to the Great Mountains, you find the Gnash-Tooth Caverns. This is no natural cave, but a festering goblin warren. The entrance is a wide, messy opening, fortified with crude palisades of sharpened sticks and scavenged metal. The ground is churned mud, littered with filth and gnawed bones. A foul stench of goblin and burnt meat hangs in the air, a blight upon the pristine forest nearby.",
