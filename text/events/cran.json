The city's bones are those of a giant; wide avenues and grand stone buildings, monuments to a time when the mountain's riches flowed freely. Now, that grandeur is tarnished. The air is thick with the smell of coal smoke and damp rock, and the once-booming sounds of industry have been replaced by a tense, watchful quiet. Many buildings are shuttered, their windows dark and empty, a testament to the city's slow strangulation by the goblin hordes in the surrounding mountains.",

The contract board is almost exclusively covered in goblin-related bounties: 'Clear the Upper Tunnels,' 'Reclaim the West Spire,' 'Escort Ore Cart.' Mercenaries, covered in grime and scars, sharpen their weapons with a grim sense of purpose. The guild clerk looks perpetually exhausted.",
