The path is a treacherous track of loose scree, flanked on one side by a sheer cliff face and on the other by a dizzying drop. The wind howls incessantly between the jagged, tooth-like peaks, carrying a permanent chill. Rockfalls are common, and the many shadowed overhangs make for perfect ambush spots.",
