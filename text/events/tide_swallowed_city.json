This is no mere village ruin; cyclopean monoliths and sharp, unfamiliar spires of green-tinged stone jut from the wet sand and shallow tidal pools. The architecture is alien, ancient beyond reckoning. The entire area is covered in barnacles and seaweed, a testament to the fact that for most of the day, these structures lie deep beneath the waves. The air smells of ancient stone and deep ocean brine.",
