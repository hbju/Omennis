            "description": "Deep within the Citrine Forest, you stumble upon a place utterly devoid of life. In a perfect circle stands a grove of white, petrified trees, their bark smooth and cold like stone. The ground is not soil but a fine, grey dust that puffs up with every footstep. No birds sing here, no insects buzz; an unnatural, profound silence hangs in the air, a stark and chilling contrast to the living woods around you.",
