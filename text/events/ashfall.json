The stone and timber houses stand as blackened, hollowed-out shells, their roofs collapsed and their doors splintered. A fine layer of grey ash, from a thousand cold campfires and burnt timbers, covers everything like a shroud. The only sounds are the mournful whistle of the wind through the empty doorways and the crunch of ash under your feet. It's a dead place.",
